## What is DaVinci Toolbox :
DaVinci Toolbox is a companion app that will simplify the installation and the use of BlackMagic DaVinci Resolve on Linux. This app is written using Python and has a GUI based on GTK4 and Adwaita. 

Currently **this program supports only Fedora Linux** in all his spins and derivatives. If the project will receive good feedback by the community I will make a version for Debian-based systems like Linux Mint and Ubuntu.

## What this app does :
DaVinci Toolbox will help you with :
- The installation of all the necessary dependencies to correctly install and start DaVinci Resolve
- Starting the official installation wizard**
- **Applying all the necessary post install tricks to properly start DaVinci Resolve
- Installing the necessary GPU drivers to make to correctly use your graphic card with DaVinci Resolve


## What OSs are currently supported :
Currently the app was tested only on these OSs :
- Fedora 40 - All spins
- Fedora 39 - All spins
- Fedora 38 - All spins
- Nobara 40
- Nobara 39
- Nobara 38

## What version of DaVinci are currently supported :
Currently the app only supports DaVinci Resolve 18.x.y. The support for DaVinci Resolve 19 will be added soon.

## What GPUs are currently supported ?
In this first release only Nvidia GPUs will be supported because we don't have any AMD or Intel GPU where to test this on. If you have an AMD or Intel GPU and want to support the project please help us testing the drivers or provide us an already working solution.

## What you can do to contribute to the project:
If you want to contribute to this project you can help us by testing the GPU drivers](https://github.com/H3rz3n/davinci-toolbox/discussions), translating the app and [making a donation]() to support the work needed for the maintenance and the continued update to keep up with the latest DaVinci version.
