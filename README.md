## What is DaVinci Toolbox :
DaVinci Toolbox is a companion app that will simplify the installation and the use of BlackMagic DaVinci Resolve on Linux. This app is written using Python and has a GUI based on GTK4 and Adwaita. 

Currently **this program supports only Fedora Linux** in all his spins and derivates. If the project will receive a good feedback by the community I will made a version for Debian-based system like Linux Mint and Ubuntu.

## What this app does :
DaVinci Toolbox will help you doing this things :
- Install all the necessary dependencies to correctly install and start DaVinci Resolve
- Help you starting the official installation wizard**
- Apply all the necessary post install tricks to properly start DaVinci Resolve
- Install the necessary GPU drivers to make to correctly use your graphic card with DaVinci Resolve

## What version of DaVinci are currently supported :
Currently the app support only DaVinci Resolve 18.x.y. In the future will be added the support for DaVinci Resolve 19.

## What GPUs are currently supported ?
In this first releases only Nvidia GPUs will be supported because we don't have any AMD or Intel GPU where to test on. If you have and AMD or Intel GPU and want to support the project please help use testing the drivers or provide as an already working solution.
